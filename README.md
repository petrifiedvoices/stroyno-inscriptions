## Abstract:
In the past two decades, several epigraphic monuments were found at the site Yurta-Stroyno and its immediate vicinity. Their discovery contributed to the archaeological knowledge of the site but also positioned the settlement into a broader context of the middle Tundzha River region. This chapter examines in detail three inscriptions associated with the site, found before 2014, and additional three objects with epigraphic value, six graffiti and two dipinti, found during the excavation of the Stroyno Archaeological Project [(SAP)](https://ukar.ff.cuni.cz/cs/veda-a-vyzkum/projekty/balkan-a-egejska-oblast/strojno/) in 2014–2016. All 14 epigraphic objects are discussed and compared with known regional parallels, further improving our understanding of the character of the Yurta-Stroyno settlement and its links to other sites in the region. Based on the textual evidence coming from the surviving inscriptions, it seems, the settlement at Yurta-Stroyno and the military camp at Kabyle, located some 40 km north of Yurta-Stroyno, were interconnected during the 2nd c. AD by personal and military associations alike.
